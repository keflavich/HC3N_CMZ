\label{fig:SLED_samples}
A figure showing the measured SLED (black) with error bars on each point that
are dominated by assumed systematic calibration errors (i.e., a 20\%
calibration error for most points), and 100 model SLEDs selected randomly from
the likelihood distribution derived from the RADEX models.
