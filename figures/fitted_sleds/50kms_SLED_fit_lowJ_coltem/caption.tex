Contour plots of the likelihood in temperature (K)-column
density ($N(H_2)$ \persc) parameter space.  The filled contours in each panel
show the permitted parameters at levels of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5-$\sigma$ for
\emph{each} line treated independently.  The unfilled contours show the
\emph{joint} marginalized constraints at the same levels.

The temperature is poorly constrainted by the included \cyano lines, 
so the lined contours are nearly vertical.
