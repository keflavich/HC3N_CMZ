Documentation for the fitting process:

Model grids are built from radex using modeling/pyradex_hc3n_grid.py

The grids are loaded into the parameter constraint tool in \texttt{code/constrain_parameters.py}

The fits are performed on a data set using the \texttt{fit\_a\_sled} tool in code/fitter.py

code/fit_sleds.py is a wrapper that runs the SLED fitter on all data in the loaded data table.
