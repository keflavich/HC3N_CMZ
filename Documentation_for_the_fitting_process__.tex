Documentation for the fitting process:

Model grids are built from radex using \texttt{modeling/pyradex\_hc3n\_grid.py}

The grids are loaded into the parameter constraint tool in \texttt{code/constrain_parameters.py}

The fits are performed on a data set using the \texttt{fit\_a\_sled} tool in code/fitter.py

\texttt{code/fit\_sleds.py} is a wrapper that runs the SLED fitter on all data in the loaded data table.
