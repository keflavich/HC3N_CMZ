Below are some spectra of the J=24-23 and J=10-9 lines from APEX and MOPRA. They are both in $T_A^*$ scale.  $\eta_{mb}\sim0.75$ for APEX, and $\eta_{eb} = 0.65$ for MOPRA, where mb = main beam and eb = extended beam, the latter of which is recommended by Jones et al.  For APEX, MB is appropriate - the emission is comparable to the beam size.
